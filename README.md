Dark Processing Theme (for 3.0)
===================

A dark theme for the Processing IDE (a little easier on the eyes!) for Processing 3.0.

## MAC INSTALLATION  
**PREFERENCES.TXT**  
Replace your `preferences.txt` with mine.

**LIB FOLDER**  
Look in `~/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Java/lib`.
Replace the files in your folder using the ones from this repository's `lib` folder (making a copy of the original in case you hate my changes!). This contains lots of changes, including all the button files. ***Don't copy the entire folder! Recent versions of the Processing app include files that, if removed, will break the IDE.***

## WINDOWS INSTALLATION  
**PREFERENCES.TXT**  
Replace your `preferences.txt` with mine, located in `%UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\Processing\`.

**LIB FOLDER**  
Look in `%HomeDrive%\processing64\processing-3.2.1\lib\`.  
[ See Mac instructions above for what to do. ]

## LINUX  
If you're on Linux, you like a challenge â€“Â I'm sure you can figure this one out ðŸ˜Š
